### Memorisation

From: https://www.youcubed.org/evidence/fluency-without-fear/

Memorisation is an inefficient an ineffective way to learn math. 

We should instead be trying to cultivate "**number sense**", and deep understanding of mathematical concepts.

Ability to memorise does not necessarily correlate well with higher ability in higher math. 

Less emphasis on calculating, but instead try to teach mathematical reasoning.

High achievers in math use both (or just either??) spatial pathways or numeric and symbolic.

Strategy-based learning is a bit better than memorisation-based learning.

Speed is not important. Some of the best mathematicians are slow.

The highest achievers focus on big ideas and the _connections_ between big ideas.

>Teachers should help students develop math facts, not by emphasizing facts for the sake of facts or using ‘timed tests’ but by encouraging students to use, work with and explore numbers. As students work on meaningful number activities they will commit math facts to heart at the same time as understanding numbers and math. They will enjoy and learn important mathematics rather than memorize, dread and fear mathematics.

Emphasis on working with and exploring numbers!

Exploring!

Some kids learn best when they can build things using things. Or when they can explore things. Active learning. Not passive memorisation!
