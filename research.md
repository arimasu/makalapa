### Memorisation



From: https://www.youcubed.org/evidence/fluency-without-fear/

Memorisation is an inefficient an ineffective way to learn math. 

We should instead be trying to cultivate "**number sense**", and deep understanding of mathematical concepts.

Ability to memorise does not necessarily correlate well with higher ability in higher math. 

Less emphasis on calculating, but instead try to teach mathematical reasoning.

High achievers in math use both (or just either??) spatial pathways or numeric and symbolic.

Strategy-based learning is a bit better than memorisation-based learning.

Speed is not important. Some of the best mathematicians are slow.

The highest achievers focus on big ideas and the _connections_ between big ideas.

>Teachers should help students develop math facts, not by emphasizing facts for the sake of facts or using ‘timed tests’ but by encouraging students to use, work with and explore numbers. As students work on meaningful number activities they will commit math facts to heart at the same time as understanding numbers and math. They will enjoy and learn important mathematics rather than memorize, dread and fear mathematics.

Emphasis on working with and exploring numbers!

Exploring!

Some kids learn best when they can build things using things. Or when they can explore things. Active learning. Not passive memorisation!

## Unsorted Thoughts

**Q: What makes things fun?**

humans learn really well by playing. in play we like:

* rewards early and often (but at varying intervals), particularly for creativity and imagination
* not being limited in what we can build / make / explore

also, when learning we are constantly balancing parsimony and wonder / curiosity

wonder / curiosity makes us want to learn more

the desire parsimony makes us want to compress our knowledge most efficiently.

A good way to kill learning is to make things not fun.

So we want to give rewards early and often for deep insights, but also not limit kids in what they are able to build or express with the language.

**Q: How to best prepare kids with better math intuition?**

* teach about binary, quaternary, and hexadecimal
* teach about logarithms
