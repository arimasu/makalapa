## Thoughts

**Q: What makes things fun?**

humans learn really well by playing. in play we like:

* rewards early and often (but at varying intervals), particularly for creativity and imagination
* not being limited in what we can build / make / explore

also, when learning we are constantly balancing parsimony and wonder / curiosity

wonder / curiosity makes us want to learn more

the desire parsimony makes us want to compress our knowledge most efficiently.

A good way to kill learning is to make things not fun.

So we want to give rewards early and often for deep insights, but also not limit kids in what they are able to build or express with the language.

**Q: How to best prepare kids with better math intuition?**

* teach about binary, quaternary, and hexadecimal
* teach about logarithms
