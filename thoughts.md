# Thoughts

_Ideas, thoughts, musings on Makatapa..._


## Todo

1. Try out subtraction and long division in the full hex form... see: http://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-division/
2. try out exponentiation, roots, and logs...
3. 




## Musings

the number line looks really cool with the makatapa hex notation!

divisions by half in particular look dopeeee.

divisions by 3 you get nice repeating patterns in the binary.

divisions by other primes (which are obv all not multiples of 2) will likely get you more interesting patterns in the binary...

1/3 --> 0.0101010101...

2/3 --> 0.1010101010...

1/5 --> 0.00110011

1/6 --> 0.00101010101 (just 1/2 of 1/3 duhhh)

1/7 --> 0.001001001001 cool!

1/9 --> 0.000111000111 wow. how is this similar to 1/3? it is 1/3 * 1/3 after all... which...

you actually need a lot of digits of 0.010101010101010101 to actually make this get the correct result with: http://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-calculator/

1/11 --> 0.0001011101 repeating (starting to look a bit nasty)

1/13 --> 0.000100111011 repeating (definitely nasty)

1/15 --> 0.000100010001 o wow that's a cool one (not a prime obviously). so that's what you get with 1/3 * 1/5... nifty...

1/17 --> 0.0000111100001111 wow wthhhh that's so simple???? 

1/19 --> 0.000011010111100101 oooh yeah there we go thasss a gross one haha...


and then the sum makes it 





**Q: What makes things fun?**

humans learn really well by playing. in play we like:

* rewards early and often (but at varying intervals), particularly for creativity and imagination
* not being limited in what we can build / make / explore

also, when learning we are constantly balancing parsimony and wonder / curiosity

wonder / curiosity makes us want to learn more

the desire parsimony makes us want to compress our knowledge most efficiently.

A good way to kill learning is to make things not fun.

So we want to give rewards early and often for deep insights, but also not limit kids in what they are able to build or express with the language.

**Q: How to best prepare kids with better math intuition?**

* teach about binary, quaternary, and hexadecimal
* teach about logarithms


### Base 16 Musings

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_system

This guy proposed base 16 for everything. seems legit.

time, music, money...


### Binary Musings

using 2 as a logarithmic base is reallly nice...
