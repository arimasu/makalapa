The spoken language we use to verbalise math and the symbols we use to represent numbers are pretty arbitrary, out of date, and differ between languages. What if we developed a universal set of sounds and symbols to represent numbers and basic Math?

We could fix a number of lingering problems and inconsistencies, optimise for truly universal pronounceability, 

Easy to Learn:

The sounds 

Easy to Understand

Easy to Use

The sounds we use to verbalise math evolved when our languages were helping us count livestock, arrange basic trades, and keep inventories of material goods. The symbols were likewise used for a similar purpose. Base 10 was used because 

Today, we have access to far more powerful and subtle mathematical concepts, and the applications of math are far different. For instance, today, we communicate almost constantly with machines. Mathematical and logical calculation in computers is expressed much more conveniently in number systems based on binary - which is, at the moment, quite incompatible and awkward to use in conventional spoken languages. 

The symbols we use 

Fun!

Most mathematical concepts are simple, and beautiful. For some people, the seemingly complex and difficult verbal and symbolic representation of numbers and basic math make it more difficult for them to learn, and create negative associations with the learning experience.

What if we made numbers actually sound and look simple and fun? What if every number word made us giggle a little bit the first time we heard it, or otherwise just made _so much sense_ that it seemed ridiculous to express it any other way.
