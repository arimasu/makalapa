## Philosophy

_Math should be:_

**ma:** Easy to learn

**ka:** Easy to understand

**ta:** Easy to use

**pa:** Fun!

## Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

\+ --> "na"

\- --> "wa na" ("the inverse or opposite of plus")

\* --> "sa"

/ --> "wa sa" ("the inverse of opposite of multiply")


## Equalities and Inequalities

= --> "lulu"

!= --> "wa lulu" ("not equal to")

\< --> "lili"

\> --> "lolo"

\<= --> "lili wi lulu" ("less than OR equal to") ("wi" means OR)

\>= --> "lolo wi lulu" ("greater than OR equal to")

\~= --> "wiwi lulu" ("approximately equal to") ("wiwi" means approximately)

## Radix Point 

. --> "la"

1.5 --> "ka la ki"

## Exponents, Logs, Roots

Inspired by the triangle of power. 

For the relationship "2 to the power of 3 = 8" :

2^3 = "ta ni pa"

3root (8) = "pa no mu" 

log_2 (8) = "mu nu ta" (note the direction here! - "8 logbase 2") (ni, nu, no and correspond to each line of the triangle, travelling clockwise around it, so "nu" goes from the result to the base of the log)

## Large Numbers / Scientific Notation

To say numbers with multiple digits, just say the numbers in order.

10 = "ka ma"

100 = "ka ma ma"

689 = "ti mu ku"

1000 = "ka ma ma ma"

This starts to sound silly and can be hard to understand after about 3 digits, so we can use scientific notation to save the day!

1000 = "ka sa kama ni pa" (literally: 1 * 10 ^ 3)

This is cool because:

Instead of learning numbers like "hundred" "million" "billion"...

We can just say the power of ten which we mean.

so thousand (x10^3) is "sakamanipa".  
million (x10^6) is "sakamaniti".

Because we almost always mean "kama" (10) is our root when we say kasakamani__, regardless of the base that we are in, we can just drop it in casual speech:

1000 = "ka sa __ ni pa"

So, in contracted form:

(in base 10)

**Big Numbers:**

* hundred (x10^2): "sanita"  
* thousand (x10^3): "sanipa" 
* ten thousand (x10^4): "sanimi" 
* hundred thousand (x10^5): "saniki" 
* million (x10^6): "saniti" 
* billion (x10^9): "saniku"
* trillion (x10^12): "sanikata"
* nonillion (x10^30): "sanipama"
* googol (10^100): "sanikamama"
* googolplex (10^(10^100)): "sa kama ni kama ni kamama" (in contracted form: "saninikamama")

**Fractions:**

* tenth (x10^-1): "wasakamanika" or "wasamanika" (or you could make the power negative: saniwaka)
* thousandth (x10^-3): "wasanipa" or "saniwapa"
* part per million (x10^-6): "wasaniti 'part'"

**Other Units**

* byte (x2^8): "satanimu"

67,491 = "tipi sanipa na mikuka" (literally: "6 7 * 10 ^ 3 + 4 9 1)

5,349,182 = "ki saniti na pamiku sanipa na kamuta" (literally: "5 * 10 ^ 6 + 3 4 9 * 10 ^ 3 + 1 8 2")

Compare this to "five million three hundred and forty nine thousand one hundred and eighty two"...

## Parentheses

_not sure about these._

( --> "sula" (add "+la" for each additional nested parantheses)

) --> "suna" (add "+na" for each additional nested parantheses)

(2 + 3) * 4 --> "sula ta na pa suna sa mi"

"_" --> "susu __ susu" (used to quote non-Makatapa symbols or words when they might be ambiguous with makatapa words.)

## Logic 

and --> "yu"

or --> "wi"

not --> "wa"

subject to / where --> "si"

therefore --> "so"

if and only if (equivalent) --> "soso"

## Bases

Makatapa provides phonemes and symbols for numbers 0-15 (base 16).

You can obviously just use the sounds and symbols for numbers 0-9 if you would like to stay in base 10.

Typically the base will be understood from context, but:

To specify base:

Base 10 --> "makatapa tu" (literally: "numbers 10")

Base 2 --> "makatapa ta" (literally: "numbers 2")

Base 16 --> "makatapa makatapa" ("all of the numbers")

You could also use base 12 for time or base 4 for other fun stuff.
